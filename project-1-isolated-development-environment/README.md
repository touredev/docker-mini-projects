
# Project 1: Isolated Development Environment

* Requirement: Create a consistent, replicable development environment that eliminates cross-platform compatibility issues.
* Summary: Package all the tools, libraries, and configurations needed for your project into a Docker container, making setup and collaboration seamless.
* Tools & Services:
    * Docker
    * Code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
    * Language-specific frameworks/tools (e.g., Node.js/npm, Python/pip, Ruby/bundler)
* High-Level Steps:
    1. Create Dockerfile: Define the base operating system image (e.g., Ubuntu, Alpine), then list steps to install all required tools, frameworks, and libraries. Copy your project code into the image.
    2. Build Image: Use the docker build command to create a reusable image from your Dockerfile.
    3. Run Container: Execute docker run to launch a container from your image. Mount your project directory into the container for seamless code synchronization.
